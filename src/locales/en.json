        {
          "question": "How does duplicate invoice detection work?",
          "answer": "FlowBills uses advanced algorithms to detect duplicate invoices by analyzing multiple data points including vendor name, invoice number, date, amount, and PO number. The system uses fuzzy matching to catch duplicates even when invoice numbers or amounts vary slightly, preventing duplicate payments before they occur."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the ROI timeline for implementing FlowBills?",
          "answer": "Most Canadian oil and gas companies see ROI within 3-6 months. Typical savings include 80% reduction in invoice processing costs, 95% straight-through processing rate, elimination of duplicate payments, faster approval cycles, and reduced audit costs. The platform typically pays for itself through reduced labor costs and prevented duplicate payments alone."

          "question": "Does FlowBills support e-invoicing and Peppol?",
          "answer": "Yes, FlowBills supports e-invoicing standards including Peppol, EN 16931, and country-specific formats. The platform can receive, validate, and process electronic invoices while maintaining compliance with Canadian and international e-invoicing regulations."
