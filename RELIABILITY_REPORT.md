### Key Reliability Features

#### **Error Recovery**
```typescript
// Automatic error boundary with recovery options
<ErrorBoundary fallback={<CustomErrorUI />}>
  <Application />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

#### **Health Monitoring**
```typescript
// Real-time system health with performance metrics
const healthStatus = await healthChecker.performHealthCheck();
// Status: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'unhealthy'
```

#### **Smart Query Management**
```typescript
// Optimized caching and retry logic
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
      retry: (count, error) => error?.status !== 404 && count < 3
    }
  }
});
```

## Audit Update (2025-05-20)

### Critical Findings & Actions

#### 1. Security Verification
- **Leaked Password Protection**: ❌ FAILED. The system accepted a weak password (`password123`). This is a critical vulnerability that must be addressed in the Supabase dashboard immediately.
- **RLS Coverage**: ✅ PASSED. Static analysis confirms RLS enablement across 68 migration files.
- **E2E Tests**: ⚠️ PARTIAL. Tests timed out due to environment constraints.

#### 2. Backend Hardening
- **Validation**: Refactored `invoice-extract` and `ocr-extract` Edge Functions to use `zod` for strict schema validation, preventing malformed inputs from reaching business logic.
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error responses to match `einvoice_receive` patterns.

#### 3. Frontend Reliability
- **Binary Uploads**: Fixed a critical bug in `Invoices.tsx` where PDF/Image uploads were corrupted by incorrect Blob-to-String conversion. Implemented `FileReader` for correct Base64 encoding.
- **Auth Flow**: Refactored `Auth.tsx` to remove unsafe `any` types and improve error logging.

#### 4. DevOps & Infrastructure
- **CI/CD**: Fixed a syntax error (duplicate `permissions` keys) in the GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), ensuring proper post-commit checks.

#### 5. Documentation
- **Feature Registry**: Created `feature_registry.md` cataloging all active functional units.
- **Audit Log**: Maintained `audit_log.md` with timestamps of all findings and actions.

**Recommendation**: Proceed to production only after enabling "Leaked Password Protection" in Supabase Auth settings.
